# Data-Exploration
Real time Covid 19 data is used to bring insights into the analysis where
two tables are created differentiating the covid deaths and covid vaccinations_
More insights in analysisng the cases vs deaths, cases vs population_
Consideration of global numbers has been done to know the country with highest death counts and infection rates,
further to understand the vaccination effect, population vs vaccinations and the percent of population vaccinated is run by forming CTE



I will explore worldwide covid-19 data. I started with two excel files named covid deaths and covid vaccinations.
